# Using Open Weather API

#### This project is created in order to fetch Api data from openweathermap.org API

**I will style and add new features later on. Now, App can only take user input and display the weather based on the input.**
**To use it, you should register for an account on openweathermap.org and get an api key => Go to app.js and paste your api key as a string into the variable named "apiKey" => start server and check your main page**
